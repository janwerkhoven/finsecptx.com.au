        <h2>FinSec PTX is a specialist pension transfer service of FinSec Partners. The PTX team are QROPS experts dedicated to helping British migrants and returning Australian citizens get the most out of their UK pension funds.</h2>
        <p>People migrating from the UK to Australia and Australians returning after working in the UK, need to consider several factors when determining what to do with any pension funds they have accumulated. The rules and laws that cover how, when and
          where funds can be transferred are complex and often built on shifting sands. Getting expert advice could potentially save you thousands of dollars.</p>
        <p>Lead by two of Australia's most respected UK pension transfer specialists, the FinSec PTX service combines a comprehensive knowledge of Australian superannuation, the UK legislative environment and pension fund complexities to provide clarity
          around the feasibility and cost of transferring your preserved UK benefits to Australia. </p>
        <p>Transfer advice considers taxation, currency and market fluctuations to provide the comparative analysis required to make an informed and confident transfer decision. </p>
        <p>If and when a transfer is deemed to be the correct course of action, FinSec's authorised advisers will arrange a compliant transfer from your UK scheme to your Australian fund. </p>
        <p>Our end-to-end service delivers a cost effective solution that assures total peace of mind for a safe and secure pension transfer.</p>

        <h2>Without the correct advice it is impossible to know whether a transfer is in your best interests or not, yet alone whether it can be carried out correctly.</h2>
        <p>Regardless of intent, simple mistakes made out of a lack of understanding can have a lifelong impact, often costing
          <nobr>thousands of dollars.</nobr>

        <p>FinSec PTX are at the forefront of both UK and Australian legislation and have become experts in interpreting its impact on the transfer process - a key reason why other advisers outsource this area of expertise to us.</p>
