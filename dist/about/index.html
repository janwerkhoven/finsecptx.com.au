          around the feasibility and cost of transferring your preserved UK benefits to Australia. </p>
        <p>Transfer advice considers taxation, currency and market fluctuations to provide the comparative analysis required to make an informed and confident transfer decision. </p>
        <p>If and when a transfer is deemed to be the correct course of action, FinSec's authorised advisers will arrange a compliant transfer from your UK scheme to your Australian fund. </p>
