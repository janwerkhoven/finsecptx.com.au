        <h2>With two of Australia's leading UK Pension Transfer Advisers, FinsecPTX has all the skills and expertise to help British migrants and returning Australian citizens alike consider what to do with their UK pensions funds.</h2>
        <p>FinSecPTX uses its comprehensive knowledge of superannuation and the associated legislative environment in the UK and in Australia, to report on the feasibility, taxation issues and cost of transferring your preserved UK benefits to an appropriate
          Australian superannuation scheme.</p>
        <p>Our advice includes the necessary detailed analysis comparing the potential UK benefits against those that would accrue under the nominated Australian scheme.</p>
        <p>If and when a transfer is deemed to be the correct course of action, FinSecPTX arranges the transfer from the UK scheme to the nominated Australian scheme.</p>
        <p>People migrating from the UK to Australia and Australians returning after working in the UK need to consider several factors when determining what to do with any retirement funds they have accumulated. The rules and laws that cover how, when and
          where funds can be transferred – and how they are treated from a taxation perspective – are complex and often built on shifting sands. The cost of failure to understand these rules and laws when transferring funds can be extremely high.</p>
